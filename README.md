# Hello there!

This project had the goal of helping the students understand and build a project using MVC (but with a different name used at school, MSC). <br>
I did almost everything that is inside the following folders: /controllers, /middlewares, /models, /services and /tests/unit. <br>
I made commits with weird messages, but that's because I was tired after days bashing my head against the wall.
